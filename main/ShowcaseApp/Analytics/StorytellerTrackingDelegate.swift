    // Note that the onUserActivityOccurred callbacks are still invoked when Event Tracking is disabled
    // This is to allow functions like Ads (which require those events - see the StorytellerAdsDelegate
    // for an example of this) to continue to work.
    // Therefore, the additional check as to whether event tracking is enabled is needed before sending
    // data to Amplitude (or any other analytics provider)
